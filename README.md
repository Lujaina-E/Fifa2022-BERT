# Fifa2022-BERT


- Analyzing the sentiment from over 50,000 mined tweets about the 2022 Fifa World Cup to observe the impacts of a Arab host country on the expeiences and regards of viewers and attendees. Upon analysis, it has been concluded that there is no direct relationship between the two.
- Trained a predictive model that can output the cluster that most closely resembles the cluster through sentiment
- Explored the data through different visual analysis tools to assess the proper model to extract meaning
 
- Technologies used: Bert-Clustering, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Transformers, Pytorch

## Future Features and Next Steps

Unfortunately, the lack of results made it less worthwhile to further develop a proper front-end interface to interact with the model. To improve the model, more significant data would need to be collected.
